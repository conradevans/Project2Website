        Hello my name is Conrad Evans I'm a freshamn at the University of
        Florida and an aspiring full stack developer.
      </p>
      <p class="details-text">
        I'm born and raised in Australia and only recently came over to U.S.
      </p>
      <p class="details-text">
        Some of my hobbies include playing basketball, golfing, and spending
        time with my friends and family.

      <p class="details-text">
        I first began coding when I was little and my mother would send me to
        coding camps, this eventually blossomed into my now passion and future
        career.
      </p>
      <p class="details-text">
        Now I spend a lot of my free time learning as much as I can about
        whatever I can in the world of Computer Science. This has led me where I
        am now as a CS major with goals of improving my coding skills and
        exploring the giant field that is Computer Science.
